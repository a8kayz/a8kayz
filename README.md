- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @a8kayz
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in film and photography, books, graffiti and comic art, and programming!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science because programming has always been my interest but I never pursued it or tried to learn it independently. I have many interests, so programming is letting me take one thing at a time :)
